# Twitter Trend Filterer

As a Twitter user, one of my major frustrations when trying to view Twitter trends are spam tweets. Whenever I visit a trend trying to know what's happening, half the tweets are people spamming the hashtags, selling something, or posting irrelevancies.

I decided to solve this problem by creating a Trend Filterer (@filtertrend). The trend filterer helps you filter 80-90% of spam tweets from trends. You can read trends in peace with little to no spam tweet interference.
